# QUICK DESCRIPTION:

This repo utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to engage in personalized conversations with users, catering to their preferred communication style. As GPT-3.5 Turbo serves as the foundation for ChatGPT, this project essentially shares its underlying model. Ultimately, the aim of this project is to develop a personal assistant that emulates human-like interactions. As the project is a work in progress, its features will expand as I continue to refine and iterate on the concept.

I highly recommend you run the python scripts as there are bugs with the exe files on Windows 11.  But, the fastest way to try these assistants would be to setup your API keys in the ```key.yaml``` file and then run the exe files I have provided.  For this to work, **you must** rename ```keys_example.yaml``` to be ```keys.yaml```.  To find the exe files, check the latest release for this project https://github.com/mani-0712/code.git
